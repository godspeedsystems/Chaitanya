## Test Cases

### 1. Core Functionality

#### Test Case: `should return repo metadata when repo_url.json exists and is valid`

-   **File:** `test/unit/get_repo_meta.test.ts`
-   **Description:** This test ensures that the function correctly reads and parses the `repo_url.json` file and returns the metadata within a `GSStatus` object.
-   **Implementation Guide:**
    -   **Setup:**
        -   Mock the `fs/promises` module, specifically the `readFile` function.
        -   Create a sample valid `RepoMeta` array.
        -   Configure the mocked `readFile` to resolve with the stringified version of the sample data when called with the correct path.
    -   **Steps:**
        1.  Call the `get_metadata` function with a mock `GSContext`.
    -   **Assertions:**
        -   Verify that the returned `GSStatus` object has `status` as `true` and `code` as `200`.
        -   Verify that the `data` property of the `GSStatus` object is deep-equal to the sample `RepoMeta` array.
        -   Ensure `fs.readFile` was called once with the expected file path.

### 2. Error Handling and Edge Cases

#### Test Case: `should return an empty array when repo_url.json does not exist`

-   **File:** `test/unit/get_repo_meta.test.ts`
-   **Description:** This test verifies that the function handles the absence of `repo_url.json` gracefully by returning an empty array.
-   **Implementation Guide:**
    -   **Setup:**
        -   Mock the `fs/promises` module, specifically the `readFile` function.
        -   Configure the mocked `readFile` to reject with an error (e.g., `ENOENT: no such file or directory`).
        -   Mock `logger.warn` to spy on its calls.
    -   **Steps:**
        1.  Call the `get_metadata` function with a mock `GSContext`.
    -   **Assertions:**
        -   Verify that the returned `GSStatus` object has `status` as `true` and `code` as `200`.
        -   Verify that the `data` property of the `GSStatus` object is an empty array.
        -   Ensure `logger.warn` was called with the expected message.

#### Test Case: `should return an empty array when repo_url.json contains invalid JSON`

-   **File:** `test/unit/get_repo_meta.test.ts`
-   **Description:** This test ensures that the function handles a corrupted or invalid `repo_url.json` file by returning an empty array.
-   **Implementation Guide:**
    -   **Setup:**
        -   Mock the `fs/promises` module, specifically the `readFile` function.
        -   Configure the mocked `readFile` to resolve with a string that is not valid JSON (e.g., `"{invalid-json}"`).
        -   Mock `logger.warn` to spy on its calls.
    -   **Steps:**
        1.  Call the `get_metadata` function with a mock `GSContext`.
    -   **Assertions:**
        -   Verify that the returned `GSStatus` object has `status` as `true` and `code` as `200`.
        -   Verify that the `data` property of the `GSStatus` object is an empty array.
        -   Ensure `logger.warn` was called with the expected message.
