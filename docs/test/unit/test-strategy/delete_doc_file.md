## Test Cases

### 1. Core Functionality

#### Test Case 1.1: Happy Path
- **File:** `delete_doc_file.test.ts`
- **Name:** `should delete the document and its metadata successfully`
- **Implementation Guide:**
  - **Setup:**
    - Mock the `VectorStore` class.
    - Mock the `removeUploadedDocs` method to resolve successfully.
    - Mock the `deleteFileMetadata` function to resolve successfully.
    - Create a mock `GSContext` with a valid `id` in `ctx.inputs.data.params`.
  - **Steps:**
    1. Call the `delete_doc_file` function with the mock context.
  - **Assertions:**
    - Expect `VectorStore.removeUploadedDocs` to be called once with the correct `id`.
    - Expect `deleteFileMetadata` to be called once with the correct `id`.
    - Expect the function to return a `GSStatus` with `success: true` and `code: 200`.
    - Expect the success message to be `Successfully deleted file with uniqueId {id}`.

### 2. Error Handling and Exception Management

#### Test Case 2.1: VectorStore Deletion Fails
- **File:** `delete_doc_file.test.ts`
- **Name:** `should return a 400 error if VectorStore fails to delete the document`
- **Implementation Guide:**
  - **Setup:**
    - Mock the `VectorStore` class.
    - Mock the `removeUploadedDocs` method to reject with an error (e.g., `new Error('VectorStore deletion failed')`).
    - Mock the `deleteFileMetadata` function.
    - Create a mock `GSContext` with a valid `id`.
  - **Steps:**
    1. Call the `delete_doc_file` function with the mock context.
  - **Assertions:**
    - Expect `VectorStore.removeUploadedDocs` to be called.
    - Expect `deleteFileMetadata` *not* to be called.
    - Expect the function to return a `GSStatus` with `success: false` and `code: 400`.
    - Expect the returned `GSStatus` data to contain an `error` object with `errorCode: 'DELETION_FAILED'` and `details: 'VectorStore deletion failed'`.

#### Test Case 2.2: Metadata Deletion Fails
- **File:** `delete_doc_file.test.ts`
- **Name:** `should return a 400 error if metadata deletion fails`
- **Implementation Guide:**
  - **Setup:**
    - Mock the `VectorStore` class.
    - Mock the `removeUploadedDocs` method to resolve successfully.
    - Mock the `deleteFileMetadata` function to reject with an error (e.g., `new Error('Metadata deletion failed')`).
    - Create a mock `GSContext` with a valid `id`.
  - **Steps:**
    1. Call the `delete_doc_file` function with the mock context.
  - **Assertions:**
    - Expect `VectorStore.removeUploadedDocs` to be called.
    - Expect `deleteFileMetadata` to be called.
    - Expect the function to return a `GSStatus` with `success: false` and `code: 400`.
    - Expect the returned `GSStatus` data to contain an `error` object with `errorCode: 'DELETION_FAILED'` and `details: 'Metadata deletion failed'`.

### 3. Input Validation
- **Note:** Input schema validation is handled by Godspeed. No specific tests are needed for missing or invalid `id` types, as the framework will reject such requests before the function is invoked.

## Coverage Matrix
