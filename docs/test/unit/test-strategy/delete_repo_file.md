## Test Cases

### 1. Core Functionality

#### Test Case 1.1: Successful Deletion

- **File Name**: `delete_repo_file.test.ts`
- **Descriptive Name**: `should successfully delete the repository file and its metadata`
- **Implementation Guide**:
    - **Setup**:
        - Mock the `VectorStore` class and its `removeUploadedDocs` method to resolve successfully.
        - Mock the `deleteRepoUrl` function to resolve successfully.
        - Create a mock `GSContext` with a valid `id` in `ctx.inputs.data.params`.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Call the `del_repo_files` function with the mock context.
    - **Assertions**:
        - Expect the mocked `logger.info` to be called with 'Unique id : ' and the correct `id`.
        - Expect `VectorStore.removeUploadedDocs` to be called once with the correct `id`.
        - Expect `deleteRepoUrl` to be called once with the correct `id`.
        - Expect the function to return a `GSStatus` with `success` as `true` and a 200 status code.

### 2. Error Handling

#### Test Case 2.1: `removeUploadedDocs` Fails

- **File Name**: `delete_repo_file.test.ts`
- **Descriptive Name**: `should return a 400 error if removeUploadedDocs fails`
- **Implementation Guide**:
    - **Setup**:
        - Mock the `VectorStore` class and its `removeUploadedDocs` method to reject with an error.
        - Mock the `deleteRepoUrl` function.
        - Create a mock `GSContext` with a valid `id`.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Call the `del_repo_files` function with the mock context.
    - **Assertions**:
        - Expect `VectorStore.removeUploadedDocs` to be called.
        - Expect `deleteRepoUrl` not to be called.
        - Expect the function to return a `GSStatus` with `success` as `false` and a 400 status code.

#### Test Case 2.2: `deleteRepoUrl` Fails

- **File Name**: `delete_repo_file.test.ts`
- **Descriptive Name**: `should return a 400 error if deleteRepoUrl fails`
- **Implementation Guide**:
    - **Setup**:
        - Mock the `VectorStore` class and its `removeUploadedDocs` method to resolve successfully.
        - Mock the `deleteRepoUrl` function to reject with an error.
        - Create a mock `GSContext` with a valid `id`.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Call the `del_repo_files` function with the mock context.
    - **Assertions**:
        - Expect `VectorStore.removeUploadedDocs` to be called.
        - Expect `deleteRepoUrl` to be called.
        - Expect the function to return a `GSStatus` with `success` as `false` and a 400 status code.

### 3. Edge Cases

#### Test Case 3.1: ID Does Not Exist

- **File Name**: `delete_repo_file.test.ts`
- **Descriptive Name**: `should handle the case where the id does not exist`
- **Implementation Guide**:
    - **Setup**:
        - Mock `VectorStore.removeUploadedDocs` to handle the case where the ID is not found (e.g., resolves without error).
        - Mock `deleteRepoUrl` to handle the case where the ID is not found (e.g., resolves without error, logs a warning).
        - Create a mock `GSContext` with a non-existent `id`.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Call the `del_repo_files` function with the mock context.
    - **Assertions**:
        - Expect `VectorStore.removeUploadedDocs` to be called with the non-existent `id`.
        - Expect `deleteRepoUrl` to be called with the non-existent `id`.
        - Expect the function to return a `GSStatus` with `success` as `true` and a 200 status code, indicating the operation completed without errors.
